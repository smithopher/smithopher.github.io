  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
  Hi! I'm Christopher Smith, a NYC based web developer. I was born in Suffern, NY and lived most of my life nearby. My professional background includes work in banking, sales and benefits&nbsp(pensions and healthcare). In high school and college I swam competitively; some of my accomplishments include being selected to the All Rockland County First Team by The Journal News five times (including one year in Middle School) and competing at the New York State Championships as a Junior and Senior in the 200 Individual Medley. My&nbspvery&nbspbest&nbspfriend&nbspis&nbspmy&nbspGolden&nbspRetriever,&nbspMilo.
